# Fake-News-Detection using Multinomial Naive Bayes Model And SVM

This project focuses on detecting whether a news article is real or fake using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**. It was developed as part of the **NSDC - HerWILL Data Science Contest**.

# Project Overview
In this project, I used:
**Multinomial Naive Bayes Model** and **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** for fake news classification.
**NLP techniques** to preprocess the news articles.
**WordCloud** for visualizing the most frequently used words in both real and fake news categories.

# Key Features
Preprocessing text data (tokenization, removing stop words, etc.).
Building a classification model to detect fake news.
Visualizing word frequencies using WordCloud.
Deploying the model for real-world application.
